# Challenge | Pipeline of Temperatures and Wildfires

![slider](captured.gif)

## Introduction

Since climate change and wildfires are topics that seem to have a correlation, relevant dataframes were searched to investigate such relationships, and also to investigate changes along the years. Enough data was found to understand such relation in the US, which was then illustrated in a hopefuly informative way.


## The steps

- Find the necessary datasets.
- Import those datasets, and do a quick exploration of its capabilities, as well as the necessary work ahead.
- Created `.gitignore` file, so I big datasets stay away from trackability.


## Stones along the way

- Stablishing the connection from SQL to Python was harder than expected.
- Issues pushing big datasets into git. Eventually crashed the repo for commiting and not pushing it.
- Temperatures dataset had a minimal timeframe of a month.
- Wildfires, on the other hand, had daily outputs, but totalled a period of just 24 years, and just in the US.


## Deliverables

A presentation on 'Google Slides':

A csv with the filtered dataset.
